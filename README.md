Hi, I'm David Journeaux, a frontend developer and growing UX/UI designer. This barebones GitHub Pages site will hold a simple collection of minor projects I've worked on.

To be frank, the past few years of my professional development have been focused on building features for Shopify as one of their software engineers, and I've not done much that reflects my current skill set within the public sphere. This site will change that, presenting new projects that demonstrate my expertise in development and user experience over time. I hope youâ€™ll appreciate and enjoy the journey as much as I intend to myself.
