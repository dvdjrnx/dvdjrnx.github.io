Hi, I'm David Journeaux, a **front-end developer** and growing **UX/UI designer**. I've created this simple GitHub Pages site to hold a collection of minor projects I've worked on over the years.

To be frank, my most recent professional development and growth has occurred within two private endeavours:

- Building features for **Shopify** as one of their software engineers
- Creating prototypes for my own passion project, **The Altered**.

In light of this, I've not done much that reflects my current skillset within the public sphere. It's my hope this site will help to change that, presenting new, public projects that demonstrate my expertise and learnings in development and user experience with time.

I hope youâ€™ll appreciate and enjoy the journey as much as I intend to myself.

#### Project description

> **TLDR**: A quick and dirty prototype of a Google Model Viewer-based 3D model dimension extractor.

This project was a prototyping test explored as part of my 3D and AR/VR work with Shopify. It tested `<model-viewer>`'s `getDimensions()` method for performance viability in a project that required quickly assessing a model's dimensions to facilitate further business logic down the line.

The prototype mounts a `<model-viewer>` instance when a file is dropped on the UI's drop zone, and the `<model-viewer>`'s `src` attribute is set to an object URL of the model. The moment the model loads, `getDimensions()` is called and x, y, and z dimensions are displayed.

Included in the code is a call to `console.time('getDimensions')` that runs on file drop, and a `console.endTime('getDimensions')` call that runs once dimensions are set in state. The results can be viewed in the console tab of Dev Tools and used to help gauge the performance viability of using `<model-viewer>` to get dimensions from models of various file sizes.

UI was not a focus for this test.
