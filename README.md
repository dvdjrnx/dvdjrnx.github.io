Hi, I'm David Journeaux, a **front-end developer** and growing **UX/UI designer**. I've created this simple GitHub Pages site to hold a collection of minor projects I've worked on over the years.

To be frank, my most recent professional development and growth has occurred within two private endeavours:

- Building features for **Shopify** as one of their software engineers
- Creating prototypes for my own passion project, **The Altered**.

In light of this, I've not done much that reflects my current skillset within the public sphere. It's my hope this site will help to change that, presenting new, public projects that demonstrate my expertise and learnings in development and user experience with time.

I hope youâ€™ll appreciate and enjoy the journey as much as I intend to myself.

This project was a prototyping test explored as part of my 3D and AR/VR work with Shopify. It tested `<model-viewer>`'s `getDimensions()` method for performance viability in a project that required quickly assessing a model's dimensions to facilitate further business logic down the line.
