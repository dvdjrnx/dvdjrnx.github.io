<br>

Hi, I'm David Journeaux, a **front-end developer** and growing **UX/UI designer**. I've created this simple GitHub Pages site to hold a collection of minor projects I've worked on over the years.

To be frank, my most recent professional development and growth has occurred within two private endeavours:

- Building features for **Shopify** as one of their software engineers
- Creating prototypes for my own passion project, **The Altered**.

In light of this, I've not done much that reflects my current skillset within the public sphere. It's my hope this site will help to change that, presenting new, public projects that accurately demonstrate my expertise and learnings in development and user experience with time.

I hope you’ll appreciate and enjoy the journey as much as I intend to myself.

#### Project description

> **TLDR**:<br>A 3D marble race game made with Three.js and React Three Fiber.
>
> **Tech used**:<br>`React` • `Three.js` • `React Three Fiber` • `React Three Rapier` • `react-postprocessing` • `Drei` • `Zustand` • `R3F-Perf` • `JavaScript` • `HTML` • `CSS`

<br>

This project brings together many concepts of working with Three.js and React Three Fiber to create an in-browser game controlled by a keyboard.

It features a marble that can be directed via arrow and WASD keys. It can also jump with the space bar. The goal is to move as quickly as possible down a track with multiple, randomized obstacles.

When you first move, a timer begins. Upon reaching the end of the track, the timer stops and shows you your time. You can then restart to beat your previous record.

The work was undertaken as one of many steps in acquiring [my Three.js certification](https://threejs-journey.com/certificate/view/24741) through [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/).

<br>

This project explores particle systems and animation in 3D and handling hundreds of thousands of particle instances in the browser. It was created with Three.js and React Three Fiber.

It features a whirling galaxy with distinct branches. The branches become more homogenous as the animation plays out. In the upper-right corner is a GUI that allows users to dynamically adjust multiple parameters for the scene, including colors, size, branches, and particle count.

<br>

This project explores scroll-based animation with 3D elements. It was created with Three.js.

It features a mock portfolio front page with floating 3D elements. The 3D elements will spin quickly in response to entering the viewport, and their position will adjust based on your mouse movement. In the upper-right corner is a GUI that allows users to dynamically adjust the color of the 3D elements.

>
> **Tech used**:<br>`React` • `Three.js` • `React Three Fiber` • `React Three Rapier` • `R3F-Perf` • `Drei` • `JavaScript` • `HTML` • `CSS`

<br>

This project explores applying physics to a 3D scene created with Three.js and React Three Fiber. At its core, it features a spinning, rectangular block. Numerous models fall into the scene under the effects of gravity and are bounced around by the block, reacting as would be reasonably expected in the real world for their individual shapes.

The project also displays a performance monitor for profiling different performance indicators, such as FPS, memory usage, and GPU load.

>
> **Tech used**:<br>`React` • `Three.js` • `React Three Fiber` • `WebGL` • `WebGL Shaders` • `Drei` • `JavaScript` • `HTML` • `CSS`

<br>

This project explores writing custom animated shaders, building a scene in blender, baking lighting, and loading the scene in Three.js. The project also makes use of React Three Fiber.

The shader work is highlighted in the glowing and shifting patterns within the portal's stone circle. The scene features a low-poly 3D scene of a lantern-lit, fenced pathway leading through rocks and tree stumps to a mysterious stone portal. An axe rests in one of the stumps, and fireflies float against a black sky.

> **Tech used**:<br>`React` • `Three.js` • `React Three Fiber` • `react-postprocessing` • `Drei` • `Leva` • `R3F-Perf` • `JavaScript` • `HTML` • `CSS`

<br>

This project explores post-processing in a 3D scene, allowing users to dynamically adjust the intensity of an animated, drunken wave effect applied over top of a simple scene. It was created with Three.js and React Three Fiber.

It features a ball and cube on a green plane. In the upper-right corner is a GUI that allows users to adjust two parameters that affect the "drunk" view distortion: frequency and amplitude.

The project also displays a performance monitor for profiling different performance indicators, such as FPS, memory usage, and GPU load.

<br>

This project explores animating WebGL shaders and patterns. It was created with Three.js.

It features a features a low-poly sea with rolling waves. In the upper-right corner is a GUI that allows users to dynamically adjust multiple parameters for the scene, including wave elevation, frequency, and speed, small wave iterations, and sea colors.

## Small prototypes

### [Model Dimension Extraction Test](https://dvdjrnx.github.io/model-viewer-dimensions)

<img src="/public/model-viewer-dimensions-banner.jpg" alt="Banner showing the model dimension extraction test UI.">

<br>

#### Project description

> **TLDR**:<br>A quick and dirty prototype of a Google Model Viewer-based 3D model dimension extractor.
>
> **Tech used**:<br>`Google Model Viewer` • `React` • `JavaScript` • `HTML` • `CSS`

<br>

This project was a prototyping test explored as part of my 3D and AR/VR work with Shopify. It tested `<model-viewer>`'s `getDimensions()` method for performance viability in a project that required quickly assessing a model's dimensions to facilitate further business logic down the line.

The prototype mounts a `<model-viewer>` instance when a file is dropped on the UI's drop zone, and the `<model-viewer>`'s `src` attribute is set to an object URL of the model. The moment the model loads, `getDimensions()` is called and x, y, and z dimensions are displayed.

Included in the code is a call to `console.time('getDimensions')` that runs on file drop, and a `console.endTime('getDimensions')` call that runs once dimensions are set in state. The results can be viewed in the console tab of Dev Tools and used to help gauge the performance viability of using `<model-viewer>` to get dimensions from models of various file sizes.

UI was not a focus for this test.
