This GitHub page holds a simple collection of minor projects I've worked on. While my recent professional work at Shopify has mainly involved feature development, it hasn't showcased my current abilities. This site will change that, presenting new projects that demonstrate my expertise in development and user experience over time. I hope you’ll appreciate and enjoy the journey as much as I intend to myself.
