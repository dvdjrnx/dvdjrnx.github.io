# Welcome to davidjourneaux.com

This site serves as a simple repository of small, salvaged projects I've tinkered with over time. To be frank, the past few years of my professional development have been focused on building features for Shopify as one of their software engineers, and so I've not done much that reflects my current skill set within the public sphere. I aim to change that here, showcasing new projects that highlight my real value in the realms of development and user experience. Stay tuned!
